# DataMining-TextClustering
For the purposes of this assignment,you will implement the bisecting k-Means clustering algorithm. You may not use libraries for this portion of your assignment.Additionally, you will gain experience with internal cluster evaluation metrics.Input data (providedas training data) consists of8580text records in sparse format.No labels are provided.For evaluation purposes (leaderboard ranking),we will use an external index metric for evaluatingclusteringsolutions. Essentially,your task is to assign each of the instances in the input data to K clusters identified from 1 to K.The train.datfile is a simple CSR sparse matrix containing the features associated with different feature idsand their countsin the input file.(Each line represents a document. Each pair of values within a line represent the term id and its count in that document)
